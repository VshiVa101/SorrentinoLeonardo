            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I’m Leonardo Sorrentino, a cosmopolitan professional with a diverse career spanning design, visual
                arts, music, theater, and social fields. While my high-level culinary experience is a significant
                strength, my ultimate goal is to build a career in web design and front-end development. My passion for
                web design has been honed through a life immersed in creativity and artistry, including Michelin-starred
                cuisine. On this site, you will find detailed information about my background, innovative projects, and
                the unique skills I’ve developed. Discover how my multidisciplinary experience and keen eye for visual
                design can enhance your initiatives and bring value to your endeavors.</p>
